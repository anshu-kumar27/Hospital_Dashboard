# HealthCRED Hospital Dashboard

A responsive, modern dashboard built using **React + Vite + Tailwind CSS + TypeScript**, this project fetches real-time hospital data via a REST API and visualizes it through interactive charts and graphs. It is optimized for performance, reusability, and clarity, while also integrating a global context for API state management.

### Design Choices & Performance Optimizations

## API Handling & Loading UX

A full-page loader (MainLoader) is displayed while essential API data is being fetched, ensuring that users interact only after the app is ready. This prevents flickering or partial renders.

## Reusability & Maintainability

Built generic and reusable UI components to eliminate repetition and speed up future development. All logic and components are modularized and organized into dedicated folders, improving readability and ease of collaboration.

## File Structure & Scalability

The project is structured with clear separation between pages, components, services, and context logic — laying the groundwork for scalable development as the app grows.
